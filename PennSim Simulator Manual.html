    <h1>PennSim Simulator Manual</h1>

Copyright notice: This document was originally created by Prof. Milo Martin at University of Pennsylvania.

<h3>Overview</h3>

This document describes the Java-based PennSim simulator (and assembler)
developed at the University of Pennsylvania.  It does not teach assembly
programming or debugging techniques.  Instead, it simply describes the features
available in the simulator. <p>

PennSim provides an interface to executing LC-3 programs on a simulated LC-3
machine.  The interface allows users to observe and effect changes to devices
(such as the graphical video display, console text output, and keyboard input).
It also allows users to control or limit the execution of a programming running
on the simulator (for example, we might want to execute a program one
instruction at a time) and observe or modify the state (memory and registers)
of the machine.</p><p>

PennSim provides both a graphical and text-based interface (the later is
specified via the '-t' flag).  Our expectation is that only the graphical
interface will be used, so this document does not describe the text interface
explicitly.  Nevertheless, most of the functionality of the graphic interface
is available (via the "Command Line") to the text interface.</p><p>

</p><h3>Running PennSim</h3>

<p>
For instructions on downloading and running the simulator, please see the <a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836494_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/pennsim-guide.html">PennSim Guide</a>.

<h3>PennSim Summary</h3>

the PennSim window consists of five components: Menus, Controls,
Registers, Memory, and Devices.  Each is described below.<p>

</p><h4>Menus</h4>
<p>
There are only two menus available ("File" and "About").  The "Open .obj File"
menu item under "File" is used to load an object file into the machine.  Note
that this can also be achieved via the "Command Line" (see below).  The "Open
Command Output Window" menu item under "File" opens a window that mirrors the
context of the "Command Line Output" panel (see Controls section, below).  This
is often useful because the Command Output Panel is somewhat small.  Finally,
the "Quit" menu item under "File" causes the simulator to terminate (after
confirmation).
</p>
<p>
The "About" menu has only one item - "Simulator Version." Use this to
make sure you're running the most current version of the simulator
that has all the latest bug fixes, features, etc.
</p>

<h4>Controls</h4>

The "Controls" section of PennSim (appearing at the top of
the simulator window) is used to control and monitor the simulated
machine. It contains four components: Execution Buttons, Machine Status
Indicator, Command Line, and Command Line Output panel.  Each are
described below.<p>

</p><h5>Execution Buttons</h5>

<p>
The Execution Buttons control the execution of a program in PennSim.
</p>

<p>
The "Next" button executes the instruction at the current PC and stops
when the PC == (current PC + 1).  If the instruction at the current PC
is a subroutine call instruction (i.e., JSR, JSRR) or a trap
instruction, the machine will execute instructions until the PC points
to the instruction <i>after</i> the JSR/JSRR/TRAP at which "Next" was
called.  "Next" is useful for walking through a program one
instruction at a time, without going into subroutines and trap
handlers.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The "Step" button is similar to "Next", but it will stop execution
again after one instruction has been executed. Thus, "Step" follows
execution <i>into</i> called functions and traps.
</p>

<p>
Both "Next" and "Step" follow branch instructions.
</p>

<p>
As an example of the results of "Next" versus "Step", consider the
following code snippet:
<table width="50%" border="1">
   <tbody><tr>
       <td>Address</td>
       <td>Label</td>
       <td>Instruction</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>x3000</td>
       <td>START</td>
       <td>AND R0,R0,#0</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>x3001</td>
       <td></td>
       <td>JSR FUNCTION</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>x3002</td>
       <td></td>
       <td>NOT R0,R0</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>x3003</td>
       <td></td>
       <td>BRz START</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>x3004</td>
       <td></td>
       <td>HALT</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>...</td>
       <td></td>
       <td></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>x4000</td>
       <td>FUNCTION</td>
       <td>ADD R0,R0,#1</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>x4001</td>
       <td></td>
       <td>RET</td>
   </tr>
</tbody></table>

If we set the <span class="command">PC</span> to <span class="command">x3000</span> and hit "Next", we will execute the <span class="command">AND</span> go to the <span class="command">JSR</span>
instruction. Hitting "Next" again will execute everything in the
function call, but the simulator won't stop until we reach the <span class="command">NOT</span> instruction, i.e. after the function has
returned. Hitting "Next" again will follow the branch and take us to
the START label.
</p>

<p>
If we set the <span class="command">PC</span> to <span class="command">x3000</span> and hit "Step", we will go to the <span class="command">JSR</span> instruction, as before. Hitting "Step"
again will take us to the <span class="command">ADD</span> instruction
inside the function call. Hitting "Step" one more time takes us to the
<span class="command">RET</span> instruction, and we have to hit
"Step" a fourth time to get to the <span class="command">NOT</span>
instruction, after the function call. Hitting "Step" again will follow
the branch and take us to the START label, just like "Next" did.
</p>

<p>
The "Continue" button starts execution with the instruction at the
current PC.  The machine will continue to execute instructions until
the machine halts, a breakpoint (see below) is encountered, or the
"Stop" button is pressed.
</p>

The "Stop" button stops execution of the machine.<p>

</p><h5>Machine Status Indicator</h5>

The Machine Status Indicator (located to the right of the Execution
Buttons) indicates the current state of the machine.  "Halted" means the
machine is halted (i.e., the "clock enable bit" of the Machine Control
Register is cleared).  "Suspended" means that the machine is not halted,
but neither is it running.  In this state you can examine and change the
state of the machine, then resume execution via the "Next", "Step", or
"Continue" buttons.  "Running" means that the machine is actively
executed instructions.<p>

Pressing the "Next", "Step", or "Continue" buttons will cause the
machine to leave the "Halted" machine state (i.e., the Machine Status
Indicator will change to "Running" then "Suspended").  If "Stop" is
pressed while the Machine Status Indicator is "Running", it will change
to "Suspended."</p><p>

</p><h5>Command Line</h5>

The Command Line (located immediately below the Execution Buttons) is
used to specify commands to control and monitor the machine.
Commands are typed on the command line and the command's output (if
any) appears in the Command Line Output panel (below).  See the
Control Commands section (below) for a description of all the
available commands.<p>

</p><h5>Command Line Output panel</h5>

The Command Line Output panel displays the output (if any) of the
commands entered into the Command Line.  If you resize the PennSim 
window, the Command Line Output panel grows and shrinks.
This is useful for making the Command Line Output panel larger so that
you may better view the output of commands that produce a lot of
output (e.g., "as").  If you are using a small monitor (e.g.,
1024x768), open the "Command Output Window" (via the "File" menu).
The Command Output Window simply mirrors the text in the Command Line
Output panel.<p>

</p><h4>Registers</h4>

<p>
The register panel is located on the left half of the screen. The processor has 
eight general purpose registers, and has a few special
registers (PC, MPR, PSR, CC). The value of each register is right next
to its label, and the value can be modified by double-clicking on the
value and typing in a new value. Values can either be in decimal, or
in hexadecimal (hexadecimal numbers must be prefixed with an 'x').
</p>

<p>
The general purpose registers are freely accessible throughout the
entire program. Whenever an executed instruction changes the value of
a register, it will automatically be updated in the Registers display
panel. It is convenient to be able to monitor the values of registers
for debugging purposes.
</p>

<p>
The special registers on the other hand, cannot be directly referenced
by the program and special instructions must be used to work with
them. It is possible to modify their values by hand in the simulator
though.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>PC</strong>, or Program Counter, indicates the address of
the next instruction to be executed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="notabene">NOTE:</span> When PennSim first starts
up, the PC is automatically set to address x0200. This will generally
be the location where the operating system begins. Generally we will
give you an operating system to load into the machine, but we may also
ask you to write parts of the operating system on your own. When the
operating system finishes executing, it will then transfer control to
the user program by jumping to location x3000. This means that
<strong>all your user programs should begin execution at address
x3000!</strong> More specifically, unless you are writing the
operating system, make sure the first line of your program is .ORIG
x3000.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>MPR</strong> is the Memory Protection Register. Each bit
in the MPR controls whether instructions in a given memory range can
be executed while in user mode (see <strong>PSR</strong> below) - 1
means that execution is allowed in a memory range in user mode, 0
means that it is only allowed in supervisor mode. Trying to execute
code in a region for which the MPR doesn't allow execution results in
an exception and will halt execution. Since the MPR is 16 bits, and
the address space has 2^<super>16</super> = 65,536 memory locations, each bit
of the MPR controls 4096 (x1000) memory locations. The table below
shows which regions of memory each MPR bit controls.

<table border="1">
   <tbody><tr>
      <th width="50%" scope="col">MPR Bit</th>
      <th>Memory Region</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>MPR[0]</td>
      <td>x0000 - x0FFF</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>MPR[1]</td>
      <td>x1000 - x1FFF</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>MPR[2]</td>
      <td>x2000 - x2FFF</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>MPR[15]</td>
      <td>xF000 - xFFFF</td>
   </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>

<p>
The <strong>PSR</strong>, or Process Status Register, indicates
whether the machine is operating in <em>supervisor mode</em> or
<em>user mode</em>. If supervisor mode is enabled, PSR[15] is
1. Supervisor mode is enabled only for the operating system code, and
it allows access to the different devices available to the machine (by
allowing access to their memory-mapped regions - see MPR
above). PSR[10:8] specify the priority level of the process being
executed. PSR[2:0] contain the bits for the condition codes
(CCs). PSR[2] is N, PSR[1] is Z, PSR[0] is P.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>CC</strong><strong>s</strong>, or condition codes, are the
3 low-order bits of the PSR that give sign information of the most
recently executed instruction that updated the codes, letting you
determine whether the value was Negative, Zero, or Positive. These are
used by the BR instruction in determining when to branch. The
instructions that update the CCs are: ADD, AND, LD, LDI, LDR, LEA, and
NOT.
</p>

<h4>Memory</h4>
<p>
The memory locations are on the right half of the screen. Each row
represents a location in memory, and the row will tell you: if there
is a breakpoint set at the location, the actual address (and any
labels that might exist there), the value, and what instruction the
value represents. Only the value of the memory can be changed by
double clicking on the current value (similar to changing register
values).
</p>

<p>The following table summarizes how memory space is mapped in the machine:</p>
<table width="50%" border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th width="50%" scope="col">Address Range</th>
    <th width="50%" scope="col">Usage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x0000 - x00FF </td>
    <td>Trap Vector Table </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x0100 - x01FF </td>
    <td>Interrupt Vector Table </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x0200 - x2FFF</td>
    <td><strong>Operating System</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x3000 - xBFFF </td>
    <td><strong>User code &amp; stack </strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xC000 - xFDFF</td>
    <td>Video output </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE00 - xFFFF </td>
    <td>Device register addresses </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4>Devices</h4>
<p>
A number of devices are available to the simulator. The simulator
uses memory-mapped device architecture, so accessing a device is just
like accessing any other memory location. Following is a table that
summarizes the device locations:
</p>
<table width="70%" border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th width="13%" scope="col">Address</th>
    <th width="24%" scope="col">Device Register</th>
    <th width="63%" scope="col">Usage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE00</td>
    <td>KBSR</td>
    <td>Keyboard Status Register: when KBSR[15] is 1, the keyboard has
    received a new character.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE02</td>
    <td>KBDR</td>
    <td>Keyboard Data Register: when a new character is available,
    KBSR[7:0] contains the ASCII value of the typed character.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE04</td>
    <td>DSR</td>
    <td>Display Status Register: when DSR[15] is 1, the display is
    ready to receive a new character to display.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE06</td>
    <td>DDR</td>
    <td>Display Data Register: when the display is ready, the display
    will print the ASCII character contained in DDR[7:0]. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE08</td>
    <td>TMR</td>
    <td>Timer Register: TMR[15] is 1 if the timer has gone off, and 0 otherwise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE0A</td>
    <td>TMI</td>
    <td>Timer Interval Register: the number of milliseconds between
    timer ticks. Setting this to 0 disables the timer, and setting it
    to 1 sets the timer to generate "ticks" from "." (period)
    characters read from the current Text I/O Device (either user
    input or a file)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFE12</td>
    <td>MPR</td>
    <td>Memory Protection Register: see <strong>Registers</strong> above.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xFFFE</td>
    <td>MCR</td>
    <td>Machine Control Register: see <strong>Registers</strong> above.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
In addition to these devices, the <strong>video output</strong> is
also memory-mapped from address location xC000 to xFDFF. The video
display is 128 by 124 pixels (15,872 pixels total) and the coordinate
system starts from (0,0) at the top left corner of the display.
</p>
<p>
Since each row is 128 pixels long, in order to find the location
exactly one row below a given location, at x0080 to it. For example,
if you are outputting to pixel (3, 10), whose memory location is
xC18A, then one row immediately below it would be xC20A (=xC18A +
x0080).
</p>
<p>
As a general rule, this is the formula to find the memory location
associated with a given (<em>row</em>, <em>col</em>):
</p>
<p>
<strong>addr = xC000 + <em>row</em>*x0080 + <em>col</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Each video output memory location represents one pixel, which means
that the value it contains must be formatted as a pixel would be
(i.e. RGB format):
</p>
<table width="23%" border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th width="14%" scope="col">[15]</th>
    <th width="24%" scope="col">[14:10]</th>
    <th width="30%" scope="col">[9:5]</th>
    <th width="32%" scope="col">[4:0]</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">0</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">RED</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">GREEN</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">BLUE</div></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p> 
A value like x7FFF (or xFFFF would work - bit 15 is actually ignored)
in location xC000 would output a white dot at (0,0). Here are a few
common colors:

  mem_addr | label | N | Z | P ] [ value | label ]</span>
  </div>
  <div>
  Verifies that a particular value resides in a register or in a
  memory location, or that a condition code is set. <span class="command">check count</span> prints the number of checks that

<p>
  </p><div>
  <span class="command">trace - usage: [on trace_file | off]</span>
  </div>
  <div>
   For each instruction executed, this command dumps a subset of
   processor state to a file, to create a trace that can be used to
   verify correctness of execution. The state consists of, in order,
   (1) PC, (2) current insn, (3) regfile write-enable, (4) regfile
   data in, (5) data memory write-enable, (6) data memory address, and
   (7) data memory data in. These values are written in hex to
   trace_file, one line for each instruction executed. Note that
   trace files can get very large very quickly!  Sometimes a signal
   may be a don't-care value - if we're not writing to the regfile,
   the `regfile data in' value is undefined - but the write-enable
   values should allow don't-care signals to be determined in all
   cases.
  </div>
  <div>
  Example: <span class="command">trace on my.trace</span> enables
  tracing. Next, run some instructions. When you're done, run the
  command <span class="command">trace off</span> to finalize the trace
  file.
