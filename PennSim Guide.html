<h2>A Gentle Guide to Using PennSim</h2>
<a name="guide"></a>

Copyright notice: This document was originally created by Prof. Milo Martin at University of Pennsylvania.

<h3>0. Conventions</h3>
<p>
Throughout this document, commands that you have to type or buttons
you have to click will appear <span class="command">like so</span>.
</p>

<h3>1. Getting Java</h3>
<p>
PennSim is written in Java, which means Java must be
installed on the computer you plan to use.  Java should already be
available on all CAE machines.  If you plan to work on your
personal machine, you may need to install Java yourself.  You can <a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">download Java here</a>. PennSim
 requires Java 1.5 or newer (which is available for
Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X).
</p>

<h3>2. Getting the Simulator</h3>
<p>
Next, you need to <a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/PennSim.jar">download the simulator</a>. It is distributed in a .jar
file (short for Java ARchive). In Windows or on a Mac, you
should be able to double-click the .jar file to launch the
simulator. You can also launch the simulator from the command line of
your operating system (such as Linux) by using the command <span class="command">java -jar (jarfile)</span>. You should see the simulator
screen, much like the screenshot below.

<h3>3. Assembling and Loading Software</h3>
<p>
Now the simulator is running, but to get it to do anything
interesting, we need to load some software. The first piece of
software we should load is, naturally, an operating system. The LC-3
operating system is very basic: it handles simple I/O operations and
is responsible for starting other programs. <a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/lc3os.asm">Download the LC-3 OS
here</a>.
</p>
<p>
So that you can understand what the operating system does, we
distribute it as an assembly language file. But the machine
doesn't understand assembly directly; we first have to 'assemble' the
assembly code into machine language (a .obj file containing binary
data). PennSim has a built-in assembler, accessible (as is
the case for most of its functionality) via the Command Line text box
(see screenshot above). To assemble the operating system, type <span class="command">as lc3os.asm</span> at PennSim's command line and hit
enter. Make sure that the OS file is in the current directory; the 
<span class="command">as</span> command also understands
relative and absolute paths if the OS is in a different directory. 
Output from the 
assembly process is displayed in the CommandLine Output Pane. After
assembling the OS, you should notice that 2 new files, lc3os.obj and
lc3os.sym, have been created. The .obj file is the machine language
encoding of the assembly language file, and the .sym file is a text
file that holds symbol information so the simulator can display your
symbols. Recall that symbols are really just a convenience for silly
humans; the machine language encoding knows only about offsets.
</p>
<p>
Now we can load the lc3os.obj file into the simulator, either via the
command <span class="command">load lc3os.obj</span> or by going to the
<span class="command">File</span> menu and selecting <span class="command">Open .obj file</span>. Notice that the contents of the
memory change when the OS is loaded.
</p>
<p>
Now assemble and load <a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/p0.asm">Example 1</a> into the simulator. The memory has changed again, but you
may not notice since the relevant memory addresses (starting at x3000)
aren't visible unless you've scrolled the screen.  User-level programs
(i.e., non-OS code) start, by convention, at x3000. If you type the
command <span class="command">list x3000</span> the memory view will
jump to x3000 and you can see the 1-instruction solution to this
problem.
</p>

<h3>4. Running Code</h3>
<p>
To actually run code, you can use the 4 control buttons at the top of
the simulator, or type commands into the command line interface (the
command names are the same as the buttons). Note that the PC register
is set to x0200, which is the entry point to the operating system by
convention. Recall that <a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/p0.asm">Example 
1</a> increments the value in R2 and puts the result in R5. Set the
value in R2 to something you fancy, either by double-clicking it in
the Registers section, or via the command <span class="command">set R2
(value)</span>. Now, actually run the code by hitting the <span class="command">continue</span> button. The value magically gets
incremented and moved to R5. Neat-o!  Also observe that the PC now
points to x0263, an apparently random value somewhere in the operating
system, and that the Status Display tells us the machine is halted.
</p>

<h3>4a. Running Code...slowly</h3>
<p>
Clearly, some things are going on here. But to determine what they are
exactly, we need to slow the execution down. You can hit the <span class="command">stop</span> button to pause the machine while it's
executing, but this doesn't give you very fine-grained control. The
<span class="command">continue</span> command will start running
instructions as fast as possible, but often we want to go just one
instruction at a time. This is what the <span class="command">next</span> and <span class="command">step</span>
commands allow us to do. They both go one instruction at a time, but the
<span class="command">step</span> command will "follow" function calls
and traps, while <span class="command">next</span> just goes from line
to line, "over" function calls and traps and stopping only at the instruction
immediately after them. Both <span class="command">next</span> and <span class="command">step</span> will "follow" branches. The <a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/pennsim-manual.html">PennSim Manual</a> has a more involved discussion,
with an example, of the difference between <span class="command">next</span> and <span class="command">step</span>.
</p>
<p>
Let's try running the program again, but just one instruction at a
time. Notice that from the halted state, the PC points to an
instruction that will branch us right back to the start of the
operating system. So we can hit <span class="command">next</span> once
and start the cycle over again. Note that registers are as we left
them. You can put a new value into R2 if you want, and the old value
in R5 will get overwritten. Sometimes, having old values lying around
everywhere can be problematic, and it's good to do a real "reboot" via
the <span class="command">reset</span> command. This clears <i>all</i>
of memory and resets registers to default values, so you have to
reload the OS and your program.
</p>
<p>
You can keep <span class="command">next</span>-ing over the OS code;
eventually you will hit the RTT instruction at location x0205 that
jumps to the start of our program at x3000. Now you can see the 2
instructions that constitute our program. You can see the ADD being
performed, and then the machine gets halted again.
</p>
<p>
Continue running the increment-R2-into-R5 code until, if ever, you get
bored. 
</p>

<h3>4b. Running Code...for a little while</h3>
<a name="guide2"></a>
<p>
Going one instruction at a time is great, but somewhat tedious. We
need a happy medium between not knowing what's going on at all, and
having to go through every single instruction, whether we care about
it or not. Breakpoints are this happy medium.
</p>
<p>
A breakpoint is set at a particular memory location, and tells the
simulator to stop execution upon reaching that point. Memory locations
with breakpoints set on them show up in the simulator with a red
square in the "BP" column. It is left as an exercise to the reader to
determine what "BP" stands for. You can set a breakpoint at a memory
location with the command <span class="command">break set (memory
location)</span>, or by checking the checkbox in the "BP" column. You
can get rid of a previously-set breakpoint with the command <span class="command">break clear (memory location)</span>, or by
un-checking a previously checked box. You can also set and clear
breakpoints at labels, instead of specifying a hex memory location.
</p>
<p>
When you tell the simulator to <span class="command">continue</span>,
it will only run until it hits a breakpoint (or the system halts or
has an error). When you are writing and testing your own code, you can use the command <span class="command">breakpoint
set START</span> to set a breakpoint at the beginning of your
code. Then, you can use <span class="command">continue</span> to skip
all the OS code and get to the instructions you care about. Then you
can <span class="command">next</span> over your code to make sure it's
doing what you want it to do.
</p>

<h3>5. Running Scripts</h3>
<p>
Now try running some of the test scripts that we've provided for
<a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/p0.asm">Example 1</a> (<a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/p0-test1.lcs">script1</a>
<a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/p0-test2.lcs">script2</a> 
<a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/p0-test3.lcs">script3</a>). You can do this with the command <span class="command">script (scriptfile)</span>. The script files just plain text (and the file extension doesn't
really matter). If you open the script file with a text editor, you can
see that the script commands are the same as those you type at the
command line. For repetitive tasks, using a script file can save you
time, and perhaps the lifelong agony of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_stress_syndrome">Repetitive
Strain Injury</a>.
</p>
<p>
Scripting is also a great way of testing your code. You can write a
few test cases and check your code easily, especially for the problems
in this homework which are pretty easy to test. Use the <span class="command">check</span> command to verify that a value is what
you think it should be. 
</p>

<h3>6. General Help and Advice</h3>
<p>
This document doesn't cover all of the simulator's functionality; for
an extended discussion of usage see the 
<a href="https://alt-5af6ed3646f67.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-12734366-dt-content-rid-58836493_1/courses/61306_1248/61306_1248_ImportedContent_20240110100718/31067_1244_ImportedContent_20230822030725/31036_1234_ImportedContent_20220822061514/61702_1228_ImportedContent_20220111114202/31799_1224_ImportedContent_20210823123858/31777_1214_ImportedContent_20200826093508/32794_1204_ImportedContent_20190830105749/Course%20Documents/simulator%20LC3/pennsim-manual.html">PennSim Manual</a>. For quick help within the simulator itself,
you can use the <span class="command">help</span> command to see a
list of all of PennSim's commands. Use <span class="command">help
(command)</span> to get help on a specific command.
</p>
<p>
Many of the PennSim commands have shortcuts - <span class="command">b</span> is short for <span class="command">break</span>, <span class="command">n</span> for
<span class="command">next</span>, and so forth. Use the <span class="command">help</span> (or <span class="command">h</span>)
command to see what shortcuts exist.
</p>
<p>
The PennSim Command Line has a history feature - use the up and down
arrow keys to go backwards and forwards through the commands you've
previously entered.
</p>
<p>
If you resize the simulator window to make it bigger, the Commandline
Output Pane will grow.  If you have a small screen and the Commandline
Output Pane still isn't big enough, you can open an external, resizable
Command Output Window by selecting the <span class="command">Open
Command Output Window</span> option from the <span class="command">File</span> menu. This lets you see a lot more output
from the commands you run, and is particularly useful for viewing the
errors the assembler generates.
</p>
<p>
If you have trouble running the simulator, contact TA by emails or drop by office hours.
